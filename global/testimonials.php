            		&ldquo;We moved to Livermore and I put my back out from the move.  The adjustments provided instant relief and his tips for stretching really helped maintain the adjustment. I visit Dr. Ammon monthly to keep everything in alignment. Yes, I would recommend Dr. Ammon to my family and friends!! Dr. Ammon even gave me his cell number in case of a weekend issue!&rdquo;

            		&ldquo;A friend recommended Dr. Ammon to me when I was in an automobile accident over ten years ago.  Since then I have in turn recommended Dr. Ammon to my parents, sibling, co-workers, and friends; all three of my children have also been treated by him.  I appreciate that Dr. Ammon focuses on solving the problem rather than just treating the symptoms. &rdquo;

            		&ldquo;I first encountered Dr. Ammon when my back first locked up and I couldn’t bend or move without pain.  My M.D. only gave me pills.  When I left Dr. Ammon’s office I walked out moving and my pain was GREATLY reduced. Since then, my back has continued to be movable with a low level of pain.&rdquo;

            		&ldquo;I came to Dr. Ammon or help with my plantar fasciitis. As an athlete, I knew it was time for me to address my chronic foot pain. Dr. Ammon discussed my problem and we worked together to establish a recovery plan. Through Dr. Ammon's therapy and my use of proper footwear, I'm happy to say that I'm 90% healed and ready to race this season.&rdquo;
